# odin-landing-page

A mock-up page to practice some HTML and CSS foundations (especially flexbox). Created for [The Odin Project's Javascript curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page).

Very much not optimised for responsiveness or mobile, just an attempt at making things look OK in a desktop browser. [Here's](https://thisisned.github.io/odin-landing-page/) the live page, and [here](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png) is the provided design that I was trying to copy.

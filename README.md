# odin-landing-page

A mock-up page to practice some HTML and CSS foundations (especially flexbox). Created for [The Odin Project's Javascript curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page).

Very much not optimised for responsiveness or mobile, just an attempt at making things look OK in a desktop browser.
